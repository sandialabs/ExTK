# `Exploration ToolKit` - `ExTK`
![ExTK_Logo_Trimmed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64920723/169656171-dfe16fe2-3718-4d4c-8d08-bfc1333f0e95.png)


## Introduction
The `Exploration ToolKit` (`ExTK`) is a reusable Extended Reality (XR) system developed for incorporating and exploring 3-Dimenstional (3-D) computer aided design (CAD) models in XR, with a primary focus on Augmented Reality (AR).  `ExTK` is developed using the [Unity Development Platform](https://unity.com/).  This is designed to be the centralized documentation for the SNL XR Training Team collaboration effort encompassing the `ExTK` project.


## Project
Please refer to the `README.md` in each branch for a specific brief summary
