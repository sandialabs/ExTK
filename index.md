# SNL XR Training Team - `ExTK`

## Introduction
`Exploration ToolKit`, or `ExTK`, is a software toolkit plugin for the Unity Development platform so software developers can easily develop exploration applications, incorporating basic exploration functionality around CAD models, for Gaming and Extended Reality (XR) environments. This is designed to be the centralized wiki for the SNL XR Training Team collaboration effort encompassing the `ExTK` project.
